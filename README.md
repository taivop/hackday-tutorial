# Machine learning tutorial at Helmes Hackday

The most important part of this tutorial is an iPython notebook. If you just want to read the notebook, you can do it on GitHub: [training_models.ipynb](training_models.ipynb).

To open and run the notebook yourself, you should:
* Install [iPython](https://ipython.org/install.html).
* In the root folder of this repo, run `ipython notebook`.
* Navigate your web browser to localhost:8888 or whichever port ipython started on (this should happen automatically).
* Click on training_models.ipynb.
* Run the code cells as appropriate.
